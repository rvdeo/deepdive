# Deepdive: Leveraging Pre-trained Deep Learning for Deep-Sea ROV Biota Identification in the Great Barrier Reef

In this repository, we give all the codes necessary to validate and load the dataset.

We also prove code to use this dataset for a simple classification task with transfer learning.

We use pre-trained models from TensorFlow keras library.


## Dataset can be downloaded from 
https://zenodo.org/records/10724993

## Running the model
- You can use the mc_classifier.py file to run the deepdive classification.
- it is configured to run with GPU acceleration
- make sure you have the proper Tensorflow and Keras implementation in your system to run the software.

## Results
you can expect to see the classification performance of multiple classifiers.

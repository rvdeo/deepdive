# Deepdive: Leveraging Pre-trained Deep Learning for Deep-Sea ROV Biota Identification in the Great Barrier Reef

In this repository, we give all the codes necessary to validate and load the dataset.

We also prove code to use this dataset for a simple classification task with transfer learning.

We use pre-trained models from TensorFlow keras library.
